Here is a script and a Makefile for generating a ncurses docset for Dash. The script is based on the dash-docset-generation-template

- ncurses: https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/

execute `make` from the same directory as this README file. The latest edition
will be downloaded from www.invisible-island.net and packaged appropriately.
