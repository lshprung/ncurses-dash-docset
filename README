Here is a script and a Makefile for generating an ncurses docset for Dash. The script is loosely based on benzado's script for GNU Make https://github.com/benzado/gnu-make-dash-docset.

- ncurses: https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/
- Dash: https://kapeli.com/dash

To generate a docset from the latest edition of ncurses, simply
execute `make` from the same directory as this README file. The latest edition
will be downloaded from www.invisible-island.net and packaged appropriately.

Requirements:

- any POSIX-compliant shell
- curl
- make
- sqlite3
